Welcome to jukebox.rb, the first music player designed specifically for agile software development teams!

With jukebox.rb, you can...
	- pool your team's music, so everyone's music gets play time
	- view and modify the playlist via a simple web front end
	- interrupt music for alerts, for example...
		- schedule a clip from a song to play at the same time every morning to let your team know it's time for stand up
		- play an unpleasant song when the build breaks (a cruise.rb plugin is included)
		- when a story card closes, play celebration tunes to recognize the team members who completed it
	- encourage frequent commits by adding more tracks from individual developer's music collections
	- discourage infrequent commits by letting the music die when there haven't been commits for a long while

More info coming soon!
